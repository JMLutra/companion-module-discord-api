# companion-module-discord-api

This module is very much in a BETA state, there is still much work to be done on reconnection logic to prevent duplicate connections or listeners.

Also, the full release version of this module will use a dedicated Companion app associated with Discord and not require every user to create their own individual apps in the Discord Developer Console. This is waiting on Discord Developer Relations staff to respend to approving of the Companion app.
